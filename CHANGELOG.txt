### 🔧 **Bug Fixes**

#### **🚫 Fixed: "Save to LiGo" Button Wasn't Working**
**The Problem:** Many users reported the "Save to LiGo" option disappeared or didn't work when right-clicking on LinkedIn profiles.

**The Fix:** We identified and fixed the technical issue preventing the context menu from loading properly. Now it works reliably every time!

#### **🧩 Fixed: Bulk Replies Missing Parts of Conversations**
**The Problem:** When generating bulk replies, some comments were being skipped or conversations appeared incomplete.

**The Fix:** We improved how we detect and organize conversation threads, so you'll now see the complete discussion before generating your replies.

#### **⚡ Fixed: CRM Modal Sometimes Wouldn't Open**
**The Problem:** Occasionally, clicking to add someone to your CRM wouldn't open the form.

**The Fix:** We added multiple backup systems to ensure the CRM form always appears when you need it.

#### **✏️ Fixed: Typing Issues in Write Panel**
**The Problem:** Users couldn't properly type, edit, or delete text in the Write tab after initial content was loaded. The cursor would jump or text wouldn't update properly.
